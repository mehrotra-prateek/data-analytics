    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are a business analyst who has been asked to identify a prime location for a takeaway burrito restaurant in London. You want to be sure to pick a location that will maximise profits. You know there are many factors to consider, including competition from other restaurants and takeaways, but there are many other factors, such as income and population density, that you know are also worth considering. It seems there is so much to consider; however, as a business analyst, you know that you can follow a set procedure to reach a sound decision about where to place your business in London. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following Jupyter Notebook will take you through this procedure one step at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted at this point that the process of finding the best location for a business is actually a complex task and requires some information that is often only commercially available. For these reasons, you will only use publicly available data sets. Another thing to note is that you will only interact with cleaned data frames for now. In reality, business analysts often spend about 70 per cent of their time finding, cleaning, reformatting and feature adapting the data. The purpose of this activity, however, is simply to give you a glimpse into how a business analyst may tackle a project and the tools they would use.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to finding the best place to start your business, you also want to produce the most popular burritos in London. To this end, you are going to develop a classification machine learning model that will predict which types of ingredients and other factors are important in creating a ‘great’ burrito. In order to do this, you will have to use pre-existing data sets available on the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this Jupyter Notebook, you will be encouraged to answer questions about what you think the data is showing you and what you might want to do next. Do your best to examine the data frames and plots and draw inferences from what you see. The steps you will be shown are intended to show you the general flow of a data science project.\n",

There are many sources for data on restaurant types and numbers in the different boroughs of London, but some are commercial and cost money to obtain. So, to start with, before going down the commercial path, you decide to search through government websites for London. "

    "Before making a final decision, you want to try to see the big picture. You decide to look at correlation maps. Correlation is similar to a trend, only we make a distinction between causation and correlation. For example, in the plot of population against number of takeaways, you saw a definite upward trend in number as population increased. Here, you might infer that the number of takeaways is 'caused' by having a larger population in the borough. That seems to make some sense. However, you have to be very careful, as population by itself is not 'causing' more takeaways. There are many factors that contribute to the number of restaurants in a borough. There may be tax breaks, lenient coding laws, different ethnicities and many other factors. Therefore, until you have performed other tests on the data (for example, coefficient of determination), all that can be said of the relationship between population and number of takeaways is that there is a correlation between the two. In this case, it is a positive correlation, meaning the population increases as the number of takeaways increases, and vice versa, the causes of which are at this point are unclear. For all you know, it could be that having more takeaways in a borough influences people to move to that borough!"
